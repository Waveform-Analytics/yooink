# Data Overview
This map shows a curated subset of the most-used OOI instruments from 
the Coastal Endurance and Axial Seamount arrays. Note that this is only the 
data available via the M2M interface so it does not include more complex 
data streams like acoustic/seismic and camera/video data. 

Below the map is a search bar which can be used to find and view 
the location of specific sensors. You can pan and zoom on this map and you can 
also click on the points to get some information about the instrument.
